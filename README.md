### whoami?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new platform.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hate frameworks :zany_face: , I still did not find a framework that I like, who cares right ðŸ¥¸. 
- Another fun fact: Golang is #1 only the C language, Linux and Unix are on the same level, but Go superseeds C cause it has it all, readable, fast, maintainable memory-safe and pretty damn simple.
- I love Football âš½, yes the name is Football not Soccer
- I use the international measure, you know. Celcius, Grams, Kilo, Centemeter and Meters, like normal people lol ï‘…
- Soccer, Inches, Pounds and Miles are brain fuck for me, lol
- In my free time I read, play Fifa and I don't code, I just build things ï˜¬.
