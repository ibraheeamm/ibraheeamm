### whoami?

I am Ibraheam from Saudi Arabia, I work as (CTO/CIO) at at [SilkySystems](https://silkysys.com) , I am passionate about coding, sports, music and art. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a new platform.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I hate frameworks :zany_face: , I still did not find a framework that I like, who cares right 🥸. 
- Another fun fact: Golang is #1 only the C language, Linux and Unix are on the same level, but Go superseeds C cause it has it all, readable, fast, maintainable memory-safe and pretty damn simple.
- I have 3 cats Labwah🐱, Laith🦁 and Ginger🐈


### Hall of fame
- Linux, do I need to explain?
- Unix, for the great minds behind it
- My Fifa squad ⚽️



### Hobbies
- Football ⚽️
- Music 🎸 I play on the Guitar and Oud

- 📖🦾 Sharing knowledge is a cause that I live to achieve it, the tech community is generous, I am giving back and contributing what I learned from my other colleuges

- Javascirpt is like the worst girlfriend I ever had 😂, Typescirpt tries to fix the relationship but you can not fix what is broken 💔😭, at the end its not the Javascirpts fault, I blame the community cause it is thriving with the worst engineering practices ever and the new framework each millisecond kills is not a fun joke anymore 🥱 not forgetting the worst of them all the **undefined** hell 💀, ooh I mean type 🧟‍♀️  
- please do not mention a framework with an ORM bla, bla, bla, if the framework is gonna code instead of me I "might" think about it good but Github Copilot started that, for web APIs made with the statically typed giants 🏋️‍♀️ bad hackable APIs are made with bad devs I am not blaming here
