### Hello Friends 👋

I am Ibraheam from Saudi Arabia, I work as (CTO/CIO) at at [SilkySystems](https://silkysys.com) , I am passionate about coding, sports, music and art. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a patented platform and many other intersting projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I hate frameworks :zany_face: , I still did not find a framework that fits my needs, hint: it must be written in Golang
- Another fun fact: Golang is #1 only the C language, Linux and Unix are in the same level, but Go superseeds C cause it has it all, readable, fast, maintainable memory-safe and pretty damn simple
- Javascirpt is like the worst girlfriend I ever had 😂, Typescirpt tries to fix the relationship but you can not fix whats broken 💔, at the end its not the Javascirpts fault, 1- the browsers are lazy parents 2- The community is thriving with the worst engineering practices ever and finally the  new framework each millisecond kills them, not forgetting the guest of honor in this list the undefined type  
- Interpreted languages are for scripts only, good web APIs made with the statically typed giants 🏋️‍♀️ 
- 💬 Ask me about anything in tech, I dont call myself a fullstack, I am the stack itself 😆 lol, but really you can ask me anything in tech
- 📖🦾 Sharing knowledge is a cause that I live to achieve it, the tech community is generous, I am giving back and contributing what I learned from my other colleuges
